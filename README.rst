IBART - I Build And Run Tests
=============================

What is IBART?
--------------
It's an tool that can initiate a full clone, build, flash, boot and test cycle initiated by a webhook from GitHub. It works with both pure software as well as hardware connected directly to the server. So, a typical use case could be that you have an embedded device that you want to re-flash new software, boot it up and then run some test cases and when done it should report back the status to the corresponding GitHub pull request.
